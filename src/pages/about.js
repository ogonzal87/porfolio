              Hi. My name is Oscar and I am addicted to coffee. Although, I blame it on the fact that I was born and raised in Colombia. I am a self-taught designer and developer. I actually went to Business School. Not by choice... ðŸ˜’ and I hated it. My passion is anything Design and Development related. When I am not creating digital things, I play my uke, ride my bike "La Negra" to get coffee, Latin dance every Wednesday, scuba dive any chance I get and I love nature so much I even trim its bush... Really, I create moss art. Check it out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/musgho/" target="_blank">
